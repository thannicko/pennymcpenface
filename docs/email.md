Hi Josefine,

I lost your number and had no way to contact you, so I had to be creative. 

I was Ronald's intern in the same group as you March 2019 to October 2019. Went to the group party, you let me crash at your place the next day, and you had (have?) a duck I made. Now, if none of this is recognizable to you, then I got the wrong person and will erase all evidence of attempting this.

If it is you, a new client I got sent me to the same campus as in 2019, and I thought of you of course. Thank you again for being super sweet to me back then. I was in quite a difficult period at that time and what you did just really helped me. I never forgot about it. I still have the map you drew for me in my wallet :)

I hope you're doing well Josefine. Would love to know what you're up to now.

Thanh.
